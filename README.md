- ðŸ‘€ I have a strong interest in the field of data science and data analytics.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am honing my coding skills in Python, R, and SQL (with visualizations in tableau) by actively acquiring diverse datasets that captivate my curiosity and through meticulous analysis, I strive to derive meaningful business insights from these datasets that could potentially help groups of people or businesses.
