- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abhiram Naredla and I'm currently a junior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Informatics (Data Science concentration) and Computer Science.
- ðŸ‘€ I have a strong passion for statistics, data science and business intelligence, and specialize in using data analysis methods to extract valuable insights from raw datasets.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am sharpening my coding skills in Python, R, and SQL (with visualizations in tableau) through HackerRank and by actively acquiring various datasets that captivate my curiosity. Through meticulous data analysis, I strive to derive meaningful insights from these datasets that could potentially help individuals or businesses. 
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me via email @abhiramnaredla@utexas.edu
